    <p> 
         Web developer since 2020, I've had the chance to work on various projects such as CRMs, ERPs, ecommerce sites, marketplaces, SDKs and Web 3 using a wide variety of technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my spare time, I love helping to improve existing open source solutions or "<a href="https://winvalided.itch.io">design video games</a>"  during game jams.
